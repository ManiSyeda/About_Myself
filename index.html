                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <li>Analyzed electronic health records (EHR) data to identify patterns and trends in patient outcomes, with a focus on reducing readmission rates.</li>
                <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
                <li>SQL for data extraction and manipulation</li>
                <li>Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing</li>
                <li>Data visualization (Tableau)</li>
                <li>Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression)</li>
                <!-- Add images or videos to showcase the project -->

                <h4>Outcomes:</h4>
                <li>Discovered correlations between certain medical procedures and reduced readmission rates.</li>
                <li>Implemented new discharge protocols based on the findings, leading to a 15% decrease in hospital readmissions</li>
                <li>Developed interactive Tableau dashboards for healthcare providers to monitor patient outcomes in real-time</li>

            </ul>
            <p>These project examples illustrate a range of data science applications, from customer churn prediction to wildlife conservation and healthcare analytics, each requiring a unique set of technologies and resulting in specific outcomes.</p>
